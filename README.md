# Soccer-League-Organizer
Console based soccer team management application

Project was implemented using directions from simulated user stories.
Almost every commit coresponds to implementing one user story.
Stories were as noted bellow:

1. As an organizer, I should be presented with menu item that allwos me to
create a new team, so that i can build a season. Required fields: team
name, coach.

2. As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me
to add players to a team, so that i can build fair teams.

3. As an organizer, I should be presented with a menu item that allows me
to remove players from a team, so that i can attemp to produce more fair
teams.

4. As an organizer adding or removin player to a yet to be chosen team, I
should be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of teams to
choose from, so that I can quickly locate the team and avoid typos.

5. As an organizer adding or removing a player to a chosen team, I should
be prompted with an alphabetically ordered list of players along with
their stats, so that i can quickly locate player and take action.

6. As na organizer planning teams, I should be able to view a report of a
chosen team grouped by height, so that i can determine if teams are
fair.

7. As an organizer who is planning teams, I should be able to see a League
Balance Report for all teams in the league showing total count of
experienced vs inexperienced players, so i can determine from a high
level if the teams are fairly balanced regarding prevoius experience.

8. As a coach of team, I should be able to print out a roster of all the
players on my team, so that i can plan appropriately.

Above user cases where considered MVP (minimum viable product). Next follows additional functionality of application:

1. As an administrator, I shouldn't be able to add more teams then there
are available players so that teams can be arranged appropriately.

2. As an administrator, I should only have the option of adding players
that are not on existing teams, so that I don't accidentaly put the
player on two teams.

3. As an administrator, my team report should show an average experience
level so that we can try to manually balance fairness.

4. As an administrator who is planning teams, the League Balance Report
should also include a count of how many players of each height are on
each team.

5. As an organizer, I should be able to select an option that builds fair
teams automatically, so that errors can be removed from the manual
addition process.
The balance option populates teams to full capacity and tries to balance
players in each team.

6. As an organizer, I should be able to add a player who missed
registration to a waiting list that will ensure that they are added to
an available team when it is their turn.

7. As an organizer, I should be able to remove players from the league and
replace them with the next player from the waiting list.
